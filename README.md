# HandWrittenDigitRecognition
This code will recognize hand written English digits

In this code we have used a Neural Network with 1 hidden layer of size 25 to recognize the hand written digits 
The size of the input image should be 20x20 pixels (though it can be customized to any size)
The accuracy of this code is 99.5% 
You can run the code with already existing data I have provided OR you can upload your own data both as training and testing
Once the network is trained you can pass through any image size of 20x20 and see how the code can recognize it.
All steps of running is available in the file RunSteps.pdf which shows screenshot of each steps of run
for any question about this code please contact mehran.yazdizadeh@gmail.com

in order to run it by yourself, follow the steps below:
1- download all files//
2- open the file ex4.m either in Octave or Matlab
3- run the code
